ExampleDragDropGrid
===================

ExampleDragDropGrid is a simple Android app that uses the drag-drop-grid Android library for creating a drag and drop grid with a delete zone.

This app is a simple example of what you can do with the drag-drop-grid library.

It allows you to:

* Add ImageViews or TextViews to the grid when pressing some buttons by different ways. It's scrollable so you can add as many as you want.

* Rearrange the views by doing a long click, and show info about the view you pressed when you do a simple click. There is another example commented in the code for changing this behaviour by setting a new OnItemClickListener or OnItemLongClickListener.
  
* There is a delete zone view where you can drop the view to delete it.

* The views generated when clicked in the buttons are of differents sizes in order to show te resize functionality. If there is no more space for another view, the items are centered in the grid layout.

* There is another example commented in the code for setting a fixed number of columns (no more than the available for the limited width of the device). Other examples are: center the items in the grid and set a fixed width and height for all the views in the grid.
